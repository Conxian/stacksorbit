# Conxian Environment Configuration (Authoritative)
# This .env is the single source of truth for addresses and keys.
# Per Hiro docs: testnet Stacks addresses start with 'ST', mainnet with 'SP'.

# ===== Authoritative Testnet Deployer =====
# This is the deployer address we will enforce across configs.
# It must be a testnet address (prefix ST) per Hiro docs.

# ===== Security Guidelines =====
# 1. NEVER commit real values to version control for production.
# 2. Back up this file securely (encrypted storage or password manager).
# 3. Prefer hardware wallets for production deployments.
# 4. Rotate keys after any suspected compromise.
# 5. Ensure NETWORK and address prefixes match (testnet => ST, mainnet => SP).
