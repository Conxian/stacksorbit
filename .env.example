# Conxian Environment Configuration (Authoritative)
# This .env is the single source of truth for addresses and keys.
# Per Hiro docs: testnet Stacks addresses start with 'ST', mainnet with 'SP'.

# ===== Core Network & API =====
HIRO_API_KEY="your_hiro_api_key_here"
STACKS_API_BASE=https://api.testnet.hiro.so
NETWORK=testnet
PROJECT_ROOT="/your/project/root/here"

# ===== Authoritative Testnet Deployer =====
# This is the deployer address we will enforce across configs.
# It must be a testnet address (prefix ST) per Hiro docs.
DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=ST...
# Private key for DEPLOYER (Address: ST...)
STACKS_DEPLOYER_PRIVKEY="your_stacks_deployer_privkey_here"
TESTNET_DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC="your_testnet_deployer_mnemonic_here"

# Keeper / SDK broadcast key (kept in sync with deployer unless you separate roles)
STACKS_PRIVKEY="your_stacks_privkey_here"

# Optional: vault contract reference (fill when available)
VAULT_CONTRACT=

# ===== System Account (Separated) =====
# Using Wallet 1 (ST...) for System Operations to allow cold-storage of Deployer
SYSTEM_ADDRESS=ST...
# Private key for SYSTEM (Address: ST...)
SYSTEM_PRIVKEY="your_system_privkey_here"
SYSTEM_MNEMONIC="your_system_mnemonic_here"

# ===== Test Wallets (optional) =====
TESTNET_WALLET1_MNEMONIC="your_testnet_wallet1_mnemonic_here"
TESTNET_WALLET2_MNEMONIC="your_testnet_wallet2_mnemonic_here"

# ===== Security Guidelines =====
# 1. NEVER commit real values to version control for production.
# 2. Back up this file securely (encrypted storage or password manager).
# 3. Prefer hardware wallets for production deployments.
# 4. Rotate keys after any suspected compromise.
# 5. Ensure NETWORK and address prefixes match (testnet => ST, mainnet => SP).
